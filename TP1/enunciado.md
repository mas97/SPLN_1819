Given a file with a list of words (one word per line), find which
words can be written as a sequence of chemical symbols (ex: ”bacon” =
Ba + Co + N).

The file [palavras.txt](palavras.txt) contains a list of words
extracted from
https://www.linguateca.pt/acesso/tokens/lemas.totalpt.txt (after
cleaning it up a little bit). Each line follows the format
`OCCURRENCES \t WORD` (the number of occurrences of that word reported
by Linguateca, followed by a "tab" character and the word).
